My research interests lie in deep reinforcement learning, deep learning, portfolio management and decentralized finance. I finished my master (major in AI and minor in Banking and Finance) at [Department of Informatics](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). 

My master thesis was supervised together by [Prof. Dr. Josef Teichmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jteichma/) (Head of Mathematics Department, ETH Zurich) and [Prof. Dr. Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/members/prof-dr-claudio-j-tessone/) (Chairman, [UZH Blockchain Center](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/) , Rank Top 1 in Europe). For my master project, I was supervised by  [Prof. Dr. Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/members/prof-dr-claudio-j-tessone/) and [Prof. Dr. Cheridito, Patrick](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~patrickc/) ([Director of RiskLab Switzerland](https://risklab.ethz.ch/)and [Director of ETH's FinsureTech Hub](https://finsuretech.ethz.ch/)).

Before this, I did double bachelor's degrees in Information Engineering at [China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (CUG)](https://en.cug.edu.cn/) and Business Administration at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), seperately. I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Wenhao Yu](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/yuwenhao/en/index.htm)(Head of Department of Space Information) at CUG. For my second degree in BA, my supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Yingjun Zhu](http://english.cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1094/1299.htm) at HUST.
