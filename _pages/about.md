### About Me

My research interests are centered around deep reinforcement learning, deep learning, portfolio management, and decentralized finance. I completed my Master's degree, majoring in Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Banking and Finance, at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html), [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html).

My Master’s thesis was co-supervised by [Prof. Dr. Josef Teichmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jteichma/) (Head of the Mathematics Department, ETH Zurich) and [Prof. Dr. Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/members/prof-dr-claudio-j-tessone/) (Chairman of the [UZH Blockchain Center](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/), ranked first in Europe). Additionally, my Master’s project was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/members/prof-dr-claudio-j-tessone/) and [Prof. Dr. Patrick Cheridito](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~patrickc/) ([Director of RiskLab Switzerland](https://risklab.ethz.ch/) and [Director of ETH's FinsureTech Hub](https://finsuretech.ethz.ch/)).

Prior to this, I completed double Bachelor's degrees: one in Information Engineering at the [China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (CUG)](https://en.cug.edu.cn/) and the other in Business Administration at the [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/). At CUG, I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Wenhao Yu](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/yuwenhao/en/index.htm) (Head of the Department of Space Information). My second degree at HUST was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Yingjun Zhu](http://english.cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1094/1299.htm).
